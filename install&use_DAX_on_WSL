#you must have WSL installed
#you must have anaconda3 and miniconda installed (see install_anaconda_miniconda_on_WSL) 
#you must have git installed = https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
#you must have pyxnat installed = https://pyxnat.github.io/pyxnat/installing.html

#EXIT MINICONDA ENVIRONMENT 
exit()

#CREATE THE DAXENV ENVIRONMENT IN PYTHON
conda create -n daxvenv python=3.10

#you can now activate or deactivate this environment
conda activate daxvenv    # Activation of environment
conda deactivate          # Deactivation of environment

#INSTALL DAX 
conda activate daxenv
pip install dax

#EDIT ~/.netrc FILE
vi ~/.netrc
#Hit the insert key - this will allow you to type in the file. Enter the following information
machine xnat.vanderbilt.edu
login username   #type your personal username in place of username 
password password #type your personal password in place of password 
#Check the permissions of the ~/.netrc file to make sure it is only readable/writable to the user (you) 
ls -l ~/.netrc
#if doing this on mac, you might need to change the .netrc file permissions using the following
$ chmod 600 ~/.netrc
#output should read something like: 
rw---- 1 bressks bressks 

#TIPS FOR EDITING FILES IN THE TERMINAL 
#Save edits you have made - hit ESC then:
  :wq
#Delete a file generated accidentally 
  rm filepath

#USING COMMAND LINE TOOLS WITH DAX 
#https://dax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dax_command_line_tools.html - there is some information here about setting environment variables in your ~/.bashrc file - for some reason this returns errors for me, so I enter the host/user/password information with the commands 

#Open the WSL and start dax environment: 
  conda activate daxvenv
#If that doesn't work you need to recreate the environment: 
  conda create -n daxvenv python=3.10
#Configure the environment variables 
  export XNAT_HOST=https://xnat.vanderbilt.edu/xnat     #make sure this is https:// not http:// 
  export XNAT_USER=username  #type your personal username in place of username  
  export PATH=/PathToMasimatlab/trunk/xnatspiders/Xnat_tools:$PATH
#check that everything is ready to run  
  XnatCheckLogin
#This should return the output: 
  No host specified, using XNAT_HOST environment variable.
  Checking login for host=https://xnat.vanderbilt.edu/xnat
  Checking connection:host=https://xnat.vanderbilt.edu/xnat, user=bressks
  --> Good login.

#HOW TO DOWNLOAD DATA FROM XNAT (see necessary arguments here:https://dax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dax_command_line_tools.html) 
#DOWNLOAD THE R MATRIX: 
 Xnatdownload --host https://xnat.vanderbilt.edu/xnat -u bressks -p ASDREST -d /home/bressks -a conncalc-asdr_v1 --ra RMATRIX
#this should produce 2 files: [1] a .txt file which contains a copy of the command you ran [2] The .csv file with the matrix 
#remember that the data is being downloaded onto the Linux virtual machine subsystem - if you want to do anything with the files on the actual compute, you will need to copy them from the subsystem to the PC

#HOW TO COPY DATA BETWEEN VM & LOCAL MACHINE (your computer)  
#If you want to copy data from the VIRTUAL MACHINE > LOCAL MACHINE, you can do this in the file explorer
#If you want to copy data from the LOCAL MACHINE > VIRTUAL MACHINE, you need to use the commands below: 
  sudo cp /mnt/c/asdr.nii.gz  /home/bressks
  #where /mnt/c/asdr.nii.gz = path and filename saved on the OS C: Drive and /home/bressks is the current working directory in the WSL.
