#[1] check to see if conda is installed
conda 
#[2] if not, install it
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

#[8]Now you need to install miniconda 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wget
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh ./Miniconda3-py39_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
